        <h1 align="center">Welcome to "A New Day"</h1>

        <h2 align="center">A game based on HTML, CSS and JavaScript programming language.</h2>

        <p align="center"><strong>It is important that you always start the game with FireFox. This game contains audio effects; Google Chrome blocks auto play audios, Firefox doesn't block them.</strong></p>

        <p align="center">The game is about a student who wakes up at 9:00 AM. he doesn't feel like going to school, but he also has some homework to handover. However, he lost his backpack at school apparently in his internship, but it is possible to be somewhere else at Elms College. You can finish the game without the backpack but not every ending is good, it is up to you, player, to find the right way to end the game.</p>
